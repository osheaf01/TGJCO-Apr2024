Write details of what you have done for the judge's consideration here. 

This should include what features you have implemented, how they work, and why you think you should win.

We've implemented a basic dice roller that validates the input, validates the diceSide and calculates the correct result.
We've also validates that the arithmetical expression has an operand and comes as a pair.
We've tried to follow clean code patterns like separation of responsibility and readability, as much as possible.

Don't expect to win, as we haven't had time to get to any of the optional features, but we've had a lot of fun coding this!
